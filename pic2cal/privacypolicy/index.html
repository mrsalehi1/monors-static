        <h1 class="section-title">Pic2Cal – Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> September 15, 2025</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Pic2Cal</strong> ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use the Pic2Cal mobile application ("App"). The app is available as "Pic 2 Calories" on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pic-2-calories/id6752662294" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS App Store</a> and "Pic2Cal" on Google Play Store (coming soon).</p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Policy describes the types of information we collect and how we use, disclose, and safeguard it when you use the App.</p>
        <h2>1) Information We Collect</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Device information:</strong> model, OS version, app version, crash/error data.</li>
          <li><strong>Usage analytics:</strong> screens viewed, taps/clicks, date navigation, meal capture events. Collected via Firebase Analytics.</li>
          <li><strong>Ads data:</strong> Ad impressions, clicks, and device identifiers used by Google Mobile Ads (AdMob) to show and measure ads.</li>
          <li><strong>Images you choose:</strong> When you select an image for meal analysis, the image is processed to generate nutrition estimates.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not collect account names or contact details inside the App unless you contact us directly.</p>
        <h2>2) How We Use Information</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide core features (meal analysis, goal calculation).</li>
          <li>Improve accuracy and reliability, fix crashes, and measure feature usage.</li>
          <li>Show non-personalized or contextual ads (where available) and manage rewarded ads gating.</li>
          <li>Prevent misuse (e.g., repeated calculations without watching ads).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>3) How Images Are Handled</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Images are sent securely to our server-side function to analyze (and to our model provider as part of that analysis).</li>
          <li>We do not retain images after processing, and we do not build user profiles from image content.</li>
          <li>Results (numbers/labels) may be cached on your device to display history; uninstalling the App removes local data.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>4) Third-Party Services</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Firebase (Analytics):</strong> helps us understand app usage in aggregate. See Google's privacy and data practices: <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a></li>
          <li><strong>Google Mobile Ads (AdMob):</strong> serves ads and measures performance; may use device identifiers. Learn more: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener">policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>These providers may process data on servers outside your country.</p>
        <h2>5) Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information. We share limited data with:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Service providers (analytics, ads, AI model/processing) strictly to operate and improve the App.</li>
          <li>Authorities when required by law or to protect rights, safety, and integrity.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>6) Data Retention</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Analytics/ads event data is retained by providers per their policies.</li>
          <li>Images are processed transiently and not stored by us after analysis.</li>
          <li>Local settings/allowance data remain on your device until you clear app data or uninstall.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>7) Your Choices</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> You can limit ad tracking/analytics in your device settings (OS privacy settings).</li>
          <li><strong>Ads:</strong> Rewarded ads are optional but may be required to unlock specific features when credits run out.</li>
          <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Uninstalling removes local app data. You can request deletion of server logs that may be reasonably linked to you by contacting us (include device ID if available).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>8) Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App is not intended for children under the age of 13 (or the equivalent age of consent in your region). We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you believe a child has provided data, contact us to remove it.</p>
        <h2>9) Security</h2>
        <p>We use industry-standard safeguards (encryption in transit, restricted access) to protect information. No method is 100% secure, but we strive to protect your data.</p>
        <h2>10) International Transfers</h2>
        <p>Your information may be processed on servers outside your country. By using the App, you consent to such transfers subject to applicable law.</p>
        <h2>11) Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Policy. Material changes will be reflected by updating the "Last updated" date. Continued use means you accept the revised Policy.</p>
        <h2>12) Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have questions, requests, or want to exercise rights (access, correction, deletion), contact:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Email: <a href="mailto:info@monors.ca">info@monors.ca</a></li>
          <li>App/package: <code>com.pic2cal.app</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you are in a region with specific rights (e.g., GDPR/CCPA), contact us and we will honor applicable requests, including access, deletion, and opt-out of sale/sharing where relevant.</p>
